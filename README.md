# Key Learnings 
 End to end data pipeline from API to visualization
 Feature engineering from audio metrics 
 Model evaluation with real world music data 
 Clear communication of results through dashboards
 
#Project Objectives 
- Extract music data( tracks, audio features, artits,popularity using Spotifys API
- Analyze and clean the data using Python(Pandas,NumPy).
- Use SQL to filter and query music data by genre,energy, popularity
- Train machine learning model to:
- Predict song popularity
- Classify genres based on audion features
- Cluster songs into groups based on listening similarities
- Build interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize

- Machine Learning Models
- Classification Genre prediction using logistic regression and Random
- Predicting track popularity from audio features
- Clusturing: K-means to group similar

- Tableau Dashboard
- Danceability vs Popularity by Genre
- Audio Feature distrubutions(Energy, Valence, Tempo)
- Year over year trends in music characteristics
- Model predictions and classification metrics
